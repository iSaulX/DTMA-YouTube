## FAQs ❓

#### Which browsers are supported?

This extension has been successfully tested on Chrome and Microsoft Edge. It might work on other Chromium-based browsers. If you do try it on another browser, please open a pull request to update this information – we'd appreciate it ❤️.

#### Do I need an Adblocker along with this extension?

Yep! This extension is only to block the YouTube anti-Adblock Pop up. I tried with [Adguard Extension](https://adguard.com/es/welcome.html) and works fine!

#### Why isn't it published on the Chrome Web Store?

Projects such as [FastForward](https://github.com/FastForwardTeam/FastForward) (a Chrome extension designed to bypass shorteners) have been removed from the Chrome Web Store due to accusations of "bypassing payments", which are incorrect. Therefore, there's a risk that this project could be taken down as well if it were published on the Chrome Web Store.

#### Can I support this project?

Yeah!❤️ Every contribution to improve this project and help the community is welcome. Check out [Contributing](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for further intructions.
